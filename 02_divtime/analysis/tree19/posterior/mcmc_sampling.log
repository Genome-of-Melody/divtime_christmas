      General explanation:                                                          
                                                                                   
      In an unrooted tree, a taxon bipartition (split) is specified by removing a   
      branch, thereby dividing the species into those to the left and those to the  
      right of the branch. Here, taxa to one side of the removed branch are denoted 
      '.' and those to the other side are denoted '*'. Specifically, the '.' symbol 
      is used for the taxa on the same side as the outgroup.                        
                                                                                   
      In a rooted or clock tree, the tree is rooted using the model and not by      
      reference to an outgroup. Each bipartition therefore corresponds to a clade,  
      that is, a group that includes all the descendants of a particular branch in  
      the tree.  Taxa that are included in each clade are denoted using '*', and    
      taxa that are not included are denoted using the '.' symbol.                  
                                                                                   
      The output first includes a key to all the bipartitions with frequency larger 
      or equual to (Minpartfreq) in at least one run. Minpartfreq is a parameter to 
      sumt command and currently it is set to 0.10.  This is followed by a table  
      with statistics for the informative bipartitions (those including at least    
      two taxa), sorted from highest to lowest probability. For each bipartition,   
      the table gives the number of times the partition or split was observed in all
      runs (#obs) and the posterior probability of the bipartition (Probab.), which 
      is the same as the split frequency. If several runs are summarized, this is   
      followed by the minimum split frequency (Min(s)), the maximum frequency       
      (Max(s)), and the standard deviation of frequencies (Stddev(s)) across runs.  
      The latter value should approach 0 for all bipartitions as MCMC runs converge.
                                                                                   
      This is followed by a table summarizing branch lengths, node heights (if a    
      clock model was used) and relaxed clock parameters (if a relaxed clock model  
      was used). The mean, variance, and 95 % credible interval are given for each 
      of these parameters. If several runs are summarized, the potential scale      
      reduction factor (PSRF) is also given; it should approach 1 as runs converge. 
      Node heights will take calibration points into account, if such points were   
      used in the analysis.                                                         
                                                                                    
      Note that Stddev may be unreliable if the partition is not present in all     
      runs (the last column indicates the number of runs that sampled the partition 
      if more than one run is summarized). The PSRF is not calculated at all if     
      the partition is not present in all runs.The PSRF is also sensitive to small  
      sample sizes and it should only be considered a rough guide to convergence    
      since some of the assumptions allowing one to interpret it as a true potential
      scale reduction factor are violated in MrBayes.

      + Convergence diagnostic (PSRF = Potential Scale Reduction Factor; Gelman
        and Rubin, 1992) should approach 1.0 as runs converge. NA is reported when
        deviation of parameter values within all runs is 0 or when a parameter
        value (a branch length, for instance) is not sampled in all runs.


      Summary statistics for partitions with frequency >= 0.10 in at least one run:
          Average standard deviation of split frequencies = 0.000000
          Maximum standard deviation of split frequencies = 0.000000
          Average PSRF for parameter values (excluding NA and >10.0) = 1.189
          Maximum PSRF for parameter values = 4.600
